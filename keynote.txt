Chaos Engineering - discipline for systematically minimizing bad luck

Learn from real world outages

Failure test your dependencies

Traditional testing assumes we know the properties of a system.  We don't.

Run experiments to discover how our systems really work.

Types of chaos eng techniques
* Failure Injection
* Fuzz testing
* Artificial resource constriction
* Randomized load swings

Run chaos engineering experiments on your human systems
