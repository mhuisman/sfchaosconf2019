Systems built by humans + humans are fallible = systems are fallible

failure must be embraced as a first class construct
when, not if
have to build in failure mode awareness into initial design

culture of transparency, blamelessness and accountability
    failure inspires blame
    fear of blame inspires guardedness
    guardedness inhibits innovation

change the language
    focus on the problem, not individuals
    collective ownership of failure, shared success
    failing for same reasons not acceptable
